## How Annotators Used the Annotation Tool

For each annotator, please follow these steps:

1. **Go to the annotation webpage**  
2. **Follow instructions to select your domain**  
3. **Work on one annotation set at a time**  

### For each PubMed abstract:

- **Select the PMID** to open the editor page (see figure, if provided).  
- The editor page shows:  
  - **PMID** link to the PubMed record  
  - **TITLE** and **ABSTRACT** text fields  
- **Annotation Categories** (above the editor window):  
  - **Specific Disease** (highlighted in yellow)  
  - **Disease Class** (green)  
  - **Composite Mention** (blue)  
  - **Modifier** (purple)  
- **Submit** button at the bottom of the editor.

### Annotation Process

1. **Annotate the title and abstract** portions of the text.  
2. **To annotate a new mention**:  
   - Select (highlight) the entire string to be annotated.  
   - Click on the appropriate category label (Specific Disease, Disease Class, Composite Mention, or Modifier).  
3. **To delete a previously annotated mention**:  
   - Highlight the string to remove.  
   - Click “Clear” above the editor.  
4. After processing, **press “Submit”** at the bottom.  
5. **To retrieve the last saved version** of your annotations, click on “Last Saved.”  
6. **To undo all annotations** for the current document and revert to the pre-annotated version, click on **“Clear ALL, start from the beginning.”**

**Pre-annotated version**:  
- Considers all mentions as **Specific Disease** by default.  
- To change the category, highlight the text and click on the appropriate category label.  
- To change the span of a previously annotated mention, highlight the desired text and click the relevant category label again.
